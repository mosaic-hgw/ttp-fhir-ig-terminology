# FHIR IG 'Terminology' for the TTP-FHIR Gateway
Implementation Guide created with FSH and IG-Publisher

## Overview

The software tools E-PIX, gPAS, and gICS are used in numerous research institutions and projects to develop Trusted Third Party Services (TTP). In order to better support the use of these tools in FHIR-based TTP infrastructures, the aim of this project is to describe the necessary profiles, extensions, and value sets, as well as their use (in the form of implementation guides).
Language.

This IG 'Terminology' focuses on code systems and value sets relevant for the implementation guides of E-PIX, gPAS, gICS and TTP-Dispatcher.

# Additional Information

The documentation and implementation was developed by the University Medicine Greifswald and initially published in 2021 as part of the following research projects:

- MIRACUM (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research 01ZZ1801M)
- NUM-CODEX (funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research 01KX2021)
